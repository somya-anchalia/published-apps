Download |long_name| at |splunkbase_url|.

Installation steps
------------------

NOTE: Where referenced, the |ia_name| and |ta_name| versions of this App are located on Splunkbase.

Deploy to single server instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow these steps to install the app in a single server instance of Splunk Enterprise:

#. Deploy as you would any App, and restart Splunk.
#. Install |ia_name|.
#. Configure.

Deploy to Splunk Cloud
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Have your Splunk Cloud Support handle this installation. Do NOT install the IA on the same system as the App.
#. You may consider using an on-premise Heavy Forwarder to install |ia_name|, and send the logs to Splunk Cloud.

Deploy to a Distributed Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. For each Search Head in the environment, deploy a non-configured copy of the App. DO NOT SEND TA or IA to a Search Head Cluster (SHC).
#. For each indexer in the environment, deploy a copy of the |ta_name| Add-On that is located as mentioned above.
#. For a single "Data Collection Node" OR "Heavy Forwarder" (a full instance of Splunk is required), install |ia_name| and configure through the GUI.
